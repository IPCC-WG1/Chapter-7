# ar6
Repository for code for everything I do with AR6

## Installation
clone the repo and then run

    pip install -e .

This will ensure that all required dependencies are installed. I highly recommend doing this in a virtual environment to not screw up your base python installation. Conda works well.

## Order
- run the notebooks in numerical order. Some later things depend on earlier things (historical temperature attribution requires working group 3 constrained ensemble, which relies on forcing being generated).

## Data
Small datasets ingested by the code are included (`data_input`). Small output datasets of general interest e.g. the ERF time series are also included (`data_output`).

Large datasets generated by the code (e.g. probablistic time series) are not included due to their size. They should be exactly reproducible thanks to fixed random seeds and live in `data_output_large`.

Most large datasets are automatically downloaded by the code into `data_input_large`, but some cannot be. The following files should be downloaded and placed into `data_input_large`:
